Question #1

Sort the String (ASCII Order)

Create a program that takes a string consisting of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers, and sorts the string in ascending ASCII order using Bubble Sort.

The sorting follows these rules:

Characters are sorted based on their ASCII values

Numbers come first, followed by uppercase letters, then lowercase letters

All characters are preserved (letters and numbers can repeat)

No special priority is given to letter case

Examples
sorting("eA2a1E") ➞ "12AEae"

sorting("Re4r") ➞ "4Rer"

sorting("6jnM31Q") ➞ "136MQjn"

sorting("846ZIbo") ➞ "468IZbo"

Notes

Sorting is done using Bubble Sort

This is a pure ASCII-based sort

No characters are removed or filtered

Question #2
Sort the Array (Ascending Order using Bubble Sort)

Create a program that takes an array of integers and sorts the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

The sorting follows these rules:

Elements are compared pairwise (adjacent elements)

If the left element is greater than the right element, they are swapped

After each pass, the largest element moves to the end of the array

All elements are preserved (duplicate values are allowed)

Examples
sorting([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]) ➞ [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]

sorting([10, 7, 3, 2]) ➞ [2, 3, 7, 10]

sorting([4, 1, 3]) ➞ [1, 3, 4]

sorting([8]) ➞ [8]

Notes

Sorting is done using Bubble Sort

The algorithm uses multiple passes through the array

Sorting is performed in-place

Time complexity: O(n²)

Question #3

Sort the Array (Ascending Order using Selection Sort)

Create a program that takes an array of integers and sorts the array in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.

The sorting follows these rules:

The array is divided into a sorted and an unsorted part

In each pass, the smallest element from the unsorted part is selected

The selected minimum element is swapped with the first element of the unsorted part

The sorted portion grows from left to right

All elements are preserved (duplicate values are allowed)

Examples

sorting([5, 3, 4, 1, 2]) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

sorting([10, 7, 3, 2]) ➞ [2, 3, 7, 10]

sorting([4, 1, 3]) ➞ [1, 3, 4]

sorting([8]) ➞ [8]

Notes

Sorting is done using Selection Sort

The algorithm uses nested loops

Only one swap is performed per pass

Sorting is performed in-place

Time complexity: O(n²)

Question #4
Stand in Line
Write a function that takes an array and a number as arguments. Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array. The function should then return the updated array.

Examples
nextInLine([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 1) ➞ [6, 7, 8, 9, 1]

nextInLine([7, 6, 3, 23, 17], 10) ➞ [6, 3, 23, 17, 10]

nextInLine([1, 10, 20, 42 ], 6) ➞ [10, 20, 42, 6]

nextInLine([], 6) ➞ "No array has been selected"
Notes
For an empty array input, return: "No array has been selected"

Question #5
Linear Search in an Array

Write a C++ program that performs a linear search on an integer array.

The program should:

Store 5 integer elements in an array.

Take an integer value from the user as input.

Search for the given value in the array using a for loop.

If the value is found, display the index at which it occurs.

If the value is not found, display a message saying "Element not found".

Notes:

The search should stop as soon as the element is found.

If the element occurs multiple times, return the index of its first occurrence.

Use a variable to track whether the element was found or not.
