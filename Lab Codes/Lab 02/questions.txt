           Question #1
======================================

Sort the String (ASCII Order)

Create a program that takes a string consisting of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers, and sorts the string in ascending ASCII order using Bubble Sort.

The sorting follows these rules:

Characters are sorted based on their ASCII values

Numbers come first, followed by uppercase letters, then lowercase letters

All characters are preserved (letters and numbers can repeat)

No special priority is given to letter case

Examples
sorting("eA2a1E") ➞ "12AEae"

sorting("Re4r") ➞ "4Rer"

sorting("6jnM31Q") ➞ "136MQjn"

sorting("846ZIbo") ➞ "468IZbo"

Notes

Sorting is done using Bubble Sort

This is a pure ASCII-based sort

No characters are removed or filtered

======================================
           Question #2
======================================
Sort the Array (Ascending Order using Bubble Sort)

Create a program that takes an array of integers and sorts the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

The sorting follows these rules:

Elements are compared pairwise (adjacent elements)

If the left element is greater than the right element, they are swapped

After each pass, the largest element moves to the end of the array

All elements are preserved (duplicate values are allowed)

Examples
sorting([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]) ➞ [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]

sorting([10, 7, 3, 2]) ➞ [2, 3, 7, 10]

sorting([4, 1, 3]) ➞ [1, 3, 4]

sorting([8]) ➞ [8]

Notes

Sorting is done using Bubble Sort

The algorithm uses multiple passes through the array

Sorting is performed in-place

Time complexity: O(n²)

======================================
           Question #3
======================================

Sort the Array (Ascending Order using Selection Sort)

Create a program that takes an array of integers and sorts the array in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.

The sorting follows these rules:

The array is divided into a sorted and an unsorted part

In each pass, the smallest element from the unsorted part is selected

The selected minimum element is swapped with the first element of the unsorted part

The sorted portion grows from left to right

All elements are preserved (duplicate values are allowed)

Examples

sorting([5, 3, 4, 1, 2]) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

sorting([10, 7, 3, 2]) ➞ [2, 3, 7, 10]

sorting([4, 1, 3]) ➞ [1, 3, 4]

sorting([8]) ➞ [8]

Notes

Sorting is done using Selection Sort

The algorithm uses nested loops

Only one swap is performed per pass

Sorting is performed in-place

Time complexity: O(n²)

======================================
           Question #4
======================================
Stand in Line
Write a function that takes an array and a number as arguments. Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array. The function should then return the updated array.

Examples
nextInLine([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 1) ➞ [6, 7, 8, 9, 1]

nextInLine([7, 6, 3, 23, 17], 10) ➞ [6, 3, 23, 17, 10]

nextInLine([1, 10, 20, 42 ], 6) ➞ [10, 20, 42, 6]

nextInLine([], 6) ➞ "No array has been selected"
Notes
For an empty array input, return: "No array has been selected"

======================================
           Question #5
======================================
Linear Search in an Array

Write a C++ program that performs a linear search on an integer array.

The program should:

Store 5 integer elements in an array.

Take an integer value from the user as input.

Search for the given value in the array using a for loop.

If the value is found, display the index at which it occurs.

If the value is not found, display a message saying "Element not found".

Notes:

The search should stop as soon as the element is found.

If the element occurs multiple times, return the index of its first occurrence.

Use a variable to track whether the element was found or not.


======================================
           Question #6
======================================
Binary Search in a Sorted Array

Write a C++ program that performs a binary search on a sorted array of integers.

The program should:

Store 6 integers in an array sorted in ascending order.

Take an integer value from the user as input.

Search for the given value using the Binary Search algorithm.

Use variables start, end, and mid to divide the search space.

If the element is found, display the index where it is located.

If the element is not found, display "Element not found".

Notes:

The array must be sorted for binary search to work correctly.

The search continues while start <= end.

Time complexity of the algorithm is O(log n)

Question: Array Operations and Searching/Sorting Program in C++

Write a C++ program that allows the user to perform various operations on an integer array. The program should support the following functionalities through a menu-driven interface:

Traverse the Array

Display all elements of the array in their current order.

If the array is empty, display an appropriate message.

Insert an Element into the Array

Prompt the user to enter a value and a position (1-based index) to insert the element.

Validate the position; if invalid, display an error message.

Shift elements as necessary to make space for the new element.

Update the size of the array accordingly.

Delete an Element from the Array

Prompt the user to enter a position (1-based index) of the element to delete.

Validate the position; if invalid, display an error message.

Shift elements to remove the element and update the array size.

Linear Search on the Array

Prompt the user to enter a value to search for.

Perform a linear search to find the first occurrence of the value.

Display the position of the element if found, otherwise display "Element not found".

Sort the Array

Provide a sub-menu with two sorting options:

Bubble Sort: Sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Selection Sort: Sort the array in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.

Display a message confirming the array has been sorted.

Binary Search on the Array

Prompt the user to enter a value to search for.

Perform a binary search (assuming the array is already sorted) to locate the element.

Display the position if found, otherwise display "Element not found".

Exit

Terminate the program when the user selects this option.

Requirements:

The program should handle a maximum array size of 100 elements.

Use functions for each operation: traverse, insert, delete, linear search, binary search, bubble sort, and selection sort.

Ensure input validation for positions when inserting or deleting elements.

Use pass-by-reference for array size (n) when it needs to be modified.

The menu should repeatedly appear until the user chooses to exit.

Display appropriate messages for all operations (success, failure, or invalid input).
