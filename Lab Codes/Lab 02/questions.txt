Question #1

Sort the String (ASCII Order)

Create a program that takes a string consisting of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers, and sorts the string in ascending ASCII order using Bubble Sort.

The sorting follows these rules:

Characters are sorted based on their ASCII values

Numbers come first, followed by uppercase letters, then lowercase letters

All characters are preserved (letters and numbers can repeat)

No special priority is given to letter case

Examples
sorting("eA2a1E") ➞ "12AEae"

sorting("Re4r") ➞ "4Rer"

sorting("6jnM31Q") ➞ "136MQjn"

sorting("846ZIbo") ➞ "468IZbo"

Notes

Sorting is done using Bubble Sort

This is a pure ASCII-based sort

No characters are removed or filtered
