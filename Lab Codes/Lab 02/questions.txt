Question #1

Sort the String (ASCII Order)

Create a program that takes a string consisting of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers, and sorts the string in ascending ASCII order using Bubble Sort.

The sorting follows these rules:

Characters are sorted based on their ASCII values

Numbers come first, followed by uppercase letters, then lowercase letters

All characters are preserved (letters and numbers can repeat)

No special priority is given to letter case

Examples
sorting("eA2a1E") ➞ "12AEae"

sorting("Re4r") ➞ "4Rer"

sorting("6jnM31Q") ➞ "136MQjn"

sorting("846ZIbo") ➞ "468IZbo"

Notes

Sorting is done using Bubble Sort

This is a pure ASCII-based sort

No characters are removed or filtered

Question #2
Sort the Array (Ascending Order using Bubble Sort)

Create a program that takes an array of integers and sorts the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

The sorting follows these rules:

Elements are compared pairwise (adjacent elements)

If the left element is greater than the right element, they are swapped

After each pass, the largest element moves to the end of the array

All elements are preserved (duplicate values are allowed)

Examples
sorting([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]) ➞ [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]

sorting([10, 7, 3, 2]) ➞ [2, 3, 7, 10]

sorting([4, 1, 3]) ➞ [1, 3, 4]

sorting([8]) ➞ [8]

Notes

Sorting is done using Bubble Sort

The algorithm uses multiple passes through the array

Sorting is performed in-place

Time complexity: O(n²)
