           Question #1
======================================

Create a simple Linked List.Assign data and traverse
list.

======================================
           Question #2
======================================
Write a C++ program to implement a singly linked list using structures.

The program should:

Create an initial linked list containing three nodes with values 10, 20, and 30.
Display (traverse) the linked list.
Insert a new node at the beginning of the list using a separate function.
Display the updated linked list after insertion.


======================================
           Question #3
======================================
Consider the given C++ program that creates and manipulates a singly linked list.

Describe the initial linked list created by the createList() function.
Explain step by step what happens when insertFirst(10) and insertAfter are called.
Show the linked list after each insertion operation.
How do the insertFirst and insertAfter functions handle memory allocation and linking of nodes?
What will happen if insertAfter is called with a nullptr as the location?
